Architecture:
I have choose to develop given task in python (version 3) and django framework with sqllite3 database, because it is easy to maintain, scalble and unit test. i haven't write the code for testing purpose.

To run the code on your local machine you need to clone the repo from github. python and pipenv should ne installed on your PC.

`git clone git@github.com:manishXperia/URLshortner.git`

`cd URLshortner`

`cd shortly`

`python manage.py makemigrations`

`python manage.py migrate`

`python manage.py runserver`
